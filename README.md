# CRASH

❗❗❗**I don't tolerate gambling because it can lead to big money losses, this is just a showcase in which I show curious people what a simple algorithm for CRASH would look like.**

❗❗❗**Let's not forget that the casinos bring us only loss and that all the games are in favor of the casinos!**


This small showcase presents a CRASH game (source code) made with a simple algorithm.
This game is written in C++.
## Compatibility:
<ul>
<li>MacOS</li>
<li>Linux (probably I didn't test it)</li>
</ul>
